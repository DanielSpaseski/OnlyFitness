  <h1><b>WW (formerly Weight Watchers)</b></h1>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>WW is a points-based system that assigns different foods and beverages a value, depending on their calorie, fat, and fiber contents.

    As you work to reach your desired weight, you must stay within your daily point allowance.
  </p>
  <h2>Health benefits</h2>
<p>Many studies show that the WW program can help you lose weight.

  For example, a review of 45 studies found that people who followed a WW diet lost 2.6% more weight than people who received standard counseling.

  Whatâ€™s more, people who follow WW programs have been shown to be more successful at maintaining weight loss after several years, compared with those who follow other diets.</p>
  <h2>Other benefits</h2>
  <p>WW allows flexibility, which makes it easy to follow. This enables people with dietary restrictions, such as those with food allergies, to adhere to the plan.</p>
  <h2>Downsides</h2>
  <p>While it allows for flexibility, WW can be costly depending on the subscription plan and the length of time you intend to follow it.

    Studies show that it may take up to 52 weeks to produce significant weight loss and clinical benefits.

    Additionally, its flexibility can be a downfall if dieters choose unhealthy foods.</p>
