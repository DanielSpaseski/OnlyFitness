  <h1><b>Low carb diets</b></h1>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Low carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.

    They’re typically higher in protein than low fat diets, which is important, as protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserves muscle mass.

    In very low carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for energy by converting them into ketones. This process is called ketosis.</p>
  <h2>Health benefits</h2>
  <p>Research suggests that low carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart disease, including high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They may also improve blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

    Many studies indicate that low carb diets can aid weight loss and may be more effective than conventional low fat diets.

    For example, a review of 53 studies made up of 68,128 participants found that low carb diets resulted in significantly more weight loss than low fat diets.

    What’s more, low carb diets appear to be quite effective at burning harmful belly fat.</p>
  <h2>Downsides</h2>
  <p>In some cases, a low carb diet may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Very low carb diets can also be difficult to follow and cause digestive upset in some people.

    In very rare situations, following a very low carb diet may cause a condition known as ketoacidosis, a dangerous metabolic condition that can be fatal if left untreated.</p>
