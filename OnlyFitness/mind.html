  <h1><b>The MIND diet</b></h1>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Like the flexitarian diet, the MIND diet does not have a strict meal plan, but instead encourages eating 10 specific foods with brain health benefits.<br>
    Per week, MIND includes eating: six or more servings of green vegetables, one serving of non-starchy vegetables, five or more servings of nuts.<br>
    Other foods it encourages multiple times a week include: berries, beans, olive oil, whole grains, fish, poultry.
  </p>
  <h2>Health benefits</h2>
  <p>Research shows that the MIND diet may reduce a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and studies show that the MIND diet is superior to other plant-rich diets for improving cognition.

    Research also shows that the MIND diet can help slow cognitive decline and improve resiliency in older adults.

    It may also help delay the onset of the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease.

    There is little research concerning the MIND diet and weight loss. Yet, since it is a combination of two diets that promote weight loss, the MIND diet may also help you lose weight.<br>
    However, more research needs to be done concerning the MIND diet and weight loss.

  </p>
  <h2>Other benefits</h2>
  <p>By combining the best of two diets, the MIND diet has a lot to offer and offers some more flexibility than stricter diets.

    While you can eat more than the 10 food groups it recommends, the closer you stick to the diet, the better your results may be.</p>
