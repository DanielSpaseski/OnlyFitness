    <h1><b>The Mayo Clinic Diet</b></h1>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Designed to be a lifestyle change over a quick fix, the Mayo Clinic Diet focuses on replacing less healthy behaviors with ones that are more likely to support longevity and weight loss.

        Rather than banning certain foods, the Mayo Clinic Diet uses a pyramid to encourage exercise and illustrate quantities of foods you should be consuming.

        Fruits, vegetables, and physical activity make up the base of the pyramid, followed by carbs in the next layer, then protein and dairy, fats, and finally, sweets.

        The diet consists of two phases. An initial, 2-week phase designed to kick-start your weight loss by introducing 5 healthier habits and encouraging you to break 5 common less healthy habits.

        The second phase is more of a lifestyle change designed to be followed long-term, encouraging education about nutritious food choices and portion sizes in addition to being physically active.</p>
    <h2>Health benefits</h2>
    <p>Little research is available about the health benefits of the Mayo Clinic Diet.

        However, the Mayo Clinic tells users to expect about 10 pounds of weight loss during the first 2 weeks, and up to 2 pounds during the second phase.

        Since diets rich in fiber can increase satiety by making you feel more full, the Mayo Clinic Diet may contribute to weight loss. It may also decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes (42Trusted Source).

        Additionally, studies show that exercising while on a lower-calorie diet is more effective at promoting weight loss than dieting alone (43Trusted Source).

        However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of the Mayo Clinic Diet for weight loss.</p>
    <h2>Downsides</h2>
    <p>While the digital version of the program includes meal plans, recipes, a food tracker, virtual group sessions, at-home workouts, and more, it will cost you monthly to buy into the program.</p>
