    <h1><b>The Mediterranean diet</b></h1>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have traditionally eaten. It is rich in: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, nuts, lentils, olive oil.
    Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited.
</p>
    <h2>Health benefits</h2>
    <p>This diet’s emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show that the Mediterranean diet has a preventive effect against certain cancers.

        Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that its plant-based, high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight loss.

        A systematic review analyzing five different studies found that, compared with a low fat diet, the Mediterranean diet resulted in greater weight loss after 1 year. Compared with a low carb diet, it produced similar weight loss results.

        One study in more than 500 adults over 12 months found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with double the likelihood of weight loss maintenance.

        Additionally, the Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals.
    <h2>Other benefits</h2>
    <p>Recent studies have also found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased risk of mental disorders, including cognitive decline and depression.

        Eating less meat is also associated with a more sustainable diet for the planet.</p>
    <h2>Downsides</h2>
    <p>Since the Mediterranean diet does not put a big emphasis on dairy products, it’s important to make sure you still get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.</p>
