  <h1><b>Plant-based and flexitarian diets</b></h1>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Typical vegetarian diets restrict meat of all kinds but allow dairy products. Typical vegan diets restrict all animal products, including dairy, butter, and sometimes other byproducts like honey.

    The flexitarian eating plan does not have clear-cut rules or recommendations about calories and macronutrients, so it’s considered more of a lifestyle than a diet. Its principles include: consuming protein from plants instead of animals, eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, limiting sugar and sweets.
    Additionally, it allows the flexibility to consume meat and animal products from time to time.
  </p>
  <h2>Health benefits</h2>
  <p>Numerous studies have shown that plant-based diets can reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases, including improved markers of metabolic health, decreased blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. They can also help you lose weight.

    Flexitarian diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and improve metabolic health and blood pressure, plus may have their own weight loss benefits.</p>
  <h2>Other benefits</h2>
  <p>For those who are looking to lead a sustainable lifestyle, decreasing your meat consumption can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and soil degradation.</p>
  <h2>Downsides</h2>
  <p>Plant-based eating patterns like vegetarianism and veganism can sometimes be difficult to maintain and may feel restricting, especially if you’re switching from a more meat-based eating style.

    And while the flexibility of the flexitarian diet makes it easy to follow, being too flexible with it may counteract its benefits.</p>
