  <h1><b>The DASH diet</b></h1>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>The DASH diet recommends specific servings of different food groups. The number of servings you are encouraged to eat depends on your daily calorie intake.

    For example, each day an average person on the DASH diet would eat about: five servings of vegetables and fruit, seven servings of healthy carbs like whole grains, two servings of low fat dairy products, two servings or fewer of lean meats.
    In addition, it’s recommended to consume nuts and seeds two to three times per week.
  </p>
  <h2>Health benefits</h2>
  <p>The DASH diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels and several heart disease risk factors. Also, it may help lower your risk of breast and colorectal cancers.

    Studies show that the DASH diet can also help you lose weight. For example, an analysis of 13 studies found that people on the DASH diet lost more weight over 8–24 weeks than people on a control diet.

    Another study in adults with obesity over 12 weeks found that the DASH diet helped decrease total body weight, body fat percentage, and absolute fat mass in study participants while preserving muscle strength.</p>
  <h2>Other benefits</h2>
  <p>In addition to weight loss, the DASH diet may help combat depression symptoms.

    A comparative study over 8 years found that even moderate adherence to the DASH diet was related to lower depression risk.</p>
  <h2>Downsides</h2>
  <p>While the DASH diet may aid with weight loss and lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, there is mixed evidence on salt intake and blood pressure.

    Eating too little salt has been linked to increased insulin resistance, and a low sodium diet isn’t the right choice for everyone.

    A low sodium diet like the DASH diet is more appropriate for individuals with hypertension or other health conditions that benefit from or require sodium restriction.

    More research is needed in this area to understand how a low sodium diet can affect insulin resistance in individuals without hypertension.</p>
