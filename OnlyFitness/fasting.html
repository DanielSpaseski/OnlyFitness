  <h1><b>Intermittent fasting</b></h1>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Intermittent fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed eating periods.
  </p>
  <h2>Health benefits</h2>
  <p>Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits.

    Both animal and human studies show that intermittent fasting may also increase heart health and extend lifespan.

    It can also help you lose weight.

    In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 0.8–13% weight loss over a period of 2 weeks to 1 year. This is a significantly greater percentage than many other methods.

    Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning while preserving muscle mass, which can improve metabolism.</p>
<h2>Other benefits</h2>
  <p>While certain diets can have a lot of rules, require frequent trips to the grocery store, and can be difficult to follow, intermittent fasting is known as a more simple-to-follow eating plan.

    Due to the nature of the diet, there are fewer meals that you need to prepare, cook, and clean up after.</p>
  <h2>Downsides</h2>
  <p>In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.

    That said, those sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels should talk with a health professional before starting intermittent fasting. These groups include people:

    who have diabetes
    who have low weight
    who have an eating disorder
    who are pregnant
    who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding</p>
